## Matrix-generator.R
Brief outline of script:

\begin{itemize}
  \item states: gives all possible states of an nxp model
  \item transitionMatrix.Classic: gives the transition matrix of an nxp classic model
  \item transitionMatrix.Modified: gives the transition matrix of an nxp modified model (see V4_time in "Voter model simulations.R" for details)
  \item calculate: returns the expected time to absorption of a given transition matrix
  \item test runs
  \item notes
\end{itemize}

## VM-theory.R
Brief outline of script:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Calculation of the time to absorption of a 3x2 classic voter model
  \item Calculation of the time to absorption of a 2x2 modified voter model
  \item Calculation of the time to absorption of a 3x2 modified voter model
\end{itemize}

See VM_time in Voter-model-simulations.R for more detail on the modified model.
