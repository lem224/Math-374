## Matrix-generator.R

Brief outline of script:

-   states: gives all possible states of an nxp model

-   transitionMatrix.Classic: gives the transition matrix of an nxp
    classic model

-   transitionMatrix.Modified: gives the transition matrix of an nxp
    modified model (see V4_time in "Voter model simulations.R" for
    details)

-   calculate: returns the expected time to absorption of a given
    transition matrix

-   test runs

-   notes

## VM-theory.R

Brief outline of script:

-   Calculation of the time to absorption of a 3x2 classic voter model

-   Calculation of the time to absorption of a 2x2 modified voter model

-   Calculation of the time to absorption of a 3x2 modified voter model

See VM_time in Voter-model-simulations.R for more detail on the modified
model.
